## Lessons Learned:

### 1. **Using Branches:**
   We learned that creating a separate branch for each feature makes it easier to manage changes without messing up other parts of the project.

### 2. **Pull Requests:**
   Using pull requests helped us review the code before adding it to the main project. This made the code better and caught mistakes early.

### 3. **Merge Conflicts:**
   Sometimes, different branches had changes that didn’t match, causing conflicts. We learned how to fix these by reviewing the changes carefully.

### 4. **Commit Messages:**
   Writing clear messages for each commit made it easier to understand what changes were made, especially when going back to review the history.

### 5. **Team Collaboration:**
   Working with Git helped us stay organized and communicate better. Syncing our branches regularly kept everyone up-to-date.

## Conclusion:
The CraftyCommerce project taught us a lot about using Git for teamwork. We learned how to manage branches, handle conflicts, and improve communication, which will help us in future projects.
